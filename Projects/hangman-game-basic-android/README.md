## Hangman
Make a basic Hangman game that displays an image of a gallows and a hanging man, along with a word that
the player is trying to guess. The word is chosen randomly from a provided dictionary. At all times the game
displays a "clue" of the letters the player has guessed correctly; for example, if the word is "apples" and
the player has guessed e, k, p, and t, the clue would be "?pp?e?". The user can type single-letter guesses into
an EditText. (The EditText allows the user to type multi-letter strings and non-letters; a robust game
would handle such attempts gracefully, as well as other errors like trying to guess the same letter twice, etc.)
You can display a message such as a Toast when the user guesses the word correctly or runs out of guesses
and ends the game.
